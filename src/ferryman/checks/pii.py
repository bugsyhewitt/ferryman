"""PII-exposure check.

Scans well-formed OFX for personally-identifiable / sensitive information
leaking into fields where it does not belong -- the bug-bounty fintech angle
is free-text memos and names echoing SSNs, full account numbers, and routing
numbers that should never travel in a statement export.

Detection classes:
- ``ssn``                     : SSN-shaped strings (NNN-NN-NNNN) in free text.
- ``account_number``          : a long account-number-shaped digit run leaking
                                into a transaction name/memo.
- ``routing_number``          : a 9-digit run that passes the ABA weighted
                                checksum -- a near-certain routing-number leak.
- ``probable_routing_number`` : a 9-digit run that fails the ABA checksum. Most
                                likely a coincidental digit run (zip+4, EIN-like
                                value, order/phone number). Emitted at ``info``
                                severity to preserve visibility without raising a
                                high-severity false positive.

For investment (INVSTMTRS) statements the same free-text scan runs over the
transaction memo, and the security identifier (``UNIQUEID`` / CUSIP) is scanned
with a narrower rule -- SSN-shaped values and over-long digit runs only -- so a
legitimate 9-digit numeric CUSIP is never mistaken for a routing number.

All evidence is redacted before it leaves the scanner -- ferryman reports the
presence of a leak, not the secret itself.
